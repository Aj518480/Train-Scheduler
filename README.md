# Train-Scheduler


By using Bootstrap, Html and CSS I was able to desgin this Train Scheduler Page. For making this Train scheduler functionally I used Javascript and JQuery. I also linked Moments.js CDN to calculate minutes away and next train arrival. This train scheduler is linked to a firebase database to hold the user inputs and making it to have live updates.
